<p><strong>Proud milestones</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>[Self Goal]</strong> Reduced our sandbox creation time from <em>40</em> minutes to <em>12</em> minutes <strong>all by myself</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designed/developed/deployed <em>logging architecture</em> with the help of <em>statsd + filebeat + elasticsearch + kibana</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Made the metric collection <em>centralized</em> which helped in reducing index size from <strong>~38GB to ~12GB</strong>.</li>
<li>Added ILM support.</li>
<li>Created different telemetry graphs in kibana.</li>
<li>Took sessions and wrote documentation on confluence to educated team about the same.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>[Self Goal]</strong> Designed/developed/deployed an architecture with which sandbox AMIs are getting created automatically and getting cleaned up automatically after 30 days <strong>all by myself</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>lamdba(Go) + serverless + sns + x-ray + buildkite + packer</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Created a ansible role called cluster <strong>all by myself</strong> which which we can create a cluster on AWS with just a yaml file and perform</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure Cluster
<ul>
<li>Ensure IAM Policies and Roles, Security Groups, Route53 Records.</li>
<li>Ensure n no of k type of nodes(instances) in m no of subnets. Bring up required no of instances, if in subnet-1 already 2 instances are present but we want 4 instances there then bring up 2 new instances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensure EBS volumes
<ul>
<li>Create/Reuse EBS vols, Attach vols, Mount vols.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Teardown Cluster
<ul>
<li>Teardown Route53 Records, Instances present in the cluster, Security Groups, IAM Roles and Policies.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>With this cluster role we are running our zookeeper, kafka, elasticsearch cluster successfully.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Created zookeeper, kafka cluster with previously mentioned cluster role from scratch <strong>all by myself</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>setted up <em>metricbeat</em> in the cluster, created <em>disk/cpu alerting</em> to <em>slack</em> via <em>elastalert</em>, zk/kafka are running as <em>systemctl service</em>, automated kafka <em>topic creation</em> flow via ansible playbooks.</li>
<li>In current implementation if anything goes wrong with any node then instance can be terminated and redeploying the playbook will create a new node with same id and attach the EBS volume of previous node to save downloading/syncing time.</li>
<li>We are successfully running this cluster from past 2 years with minimal outages so far.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>[Self Goal]</strong> Fixed broken <em>shared sandboxes</em>. Earlier people weren&rsquo;t using them since they were broken and were very out of date after fixing people are utilizing them to the fullest.</p>

<li>created test cluster, performed upgrade and tested with sandbox.</li>
<li>removed <em>lazy loading</em> after migration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>[Self Goal]</strong> Created iam role/permissions so that normal developer can assign/reassign new MFA devices to their accounts by themselves, this <em>offloaded work from platform team</em>, dev don&rsquo;t need to share the QR codes anymore and wait.</p>
<ul>
